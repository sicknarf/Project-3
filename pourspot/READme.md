## Wins

##### *Collaboration*
From the start, we had effective and efficient organization, communication, and collaboration. As this was our first group project, our goal was to make an inclusive and open experience for all team members. We established roles and divided tasks but we were constantly checking in with each other prior to making any decisions. This made it a safe space to share ideas throughout the entire project.

We made sure we had constant communication with the Git Manager which led to minimal conflicts in github. It was a team effort whenever errors or bugs came about. Each member's voice was heard, acknowleged, and accepted. This behavior and process is reflected in our project. 

We truly had a great time working together. It was great to see each member shine in their own strengths. We celebrated every big & small wins together. HELP PLEASE?!?!? IM BEING TOO SAPPY LOL!



## Challenges

##### *Many to Many (Recipes)*
A few challenges we faced as a group was the initial many-to-many (M:M) relationship between recipes and ingredients. We were able to save the ingredients in the admin portal but the ingredients would not reflect in our front-end recipe form. To resolve this, we added:

##### *Heroku????????*
Another step that held us back was deploying our app in Heroku

##### *Materialize*
Lastly, Materialize was a tool that took us some time to familiarize ourselves with. The syntax and placement of keywords was tricky at first but we quickly learned and utilized the available features.
